Simple and Compound Machines
===========================
This project is meant to serve as an introduction for compound machines, as well
as the simple machines they are composed of. The guide will be focusing
specifically on educating people enough to be prepared for the compound machines
challenge in the *Science Olympiad*. However, people who want to learn the
basics of compound machines can benefit from reading this as well, as it will
give them a general knowledge of the subject.

Readers can expect to be able to read this document from the top down. Topics
will be organized by the level of knowledge required to read learn them. For
instance, you can expect to learn about a lever before you learn of machines
utilizing levers.

Additionally, readers will learn the expectations of the compound machines
portion of the *Science Olympiad*, as well as how the competition will work. All
in all, you can expect to be totally prepared for the competition after reading
this document, provided you study the material.

*Science Olympiad* Competition
----------------------------
During the *Science Olympiad*, competitors will be tested on their knowledge of
compound machines by being asked questions on them. Additionally, they are
expected to use a compound lever to determine the quantity of an unknown mass.
The former will require studying, whereas the latter requires competitors to
have a good understanding of *mechanical advantage*. Additionally, students
will have to build a compound lever themselves, as their prebuild.

Officially, the event is split into two parts. The first part is the written
test. The test will include questions on basic concepts of compound machines,
as well as calculations and the history of compound machines. For the second
event, competitors are given a known mass and an unknown mass. Using a compound
lever, they are expected to determine the unknown mass. The second portion of
the competition will be graded on accuracy and speed.

Competitors are expected to bring their compound lever, a binder of notes, a
calculator, and other tools or supplies. Materials held in the binder should be
firmly within it. Judges can be expected to turn the binders upside down, to
test if anything falls out. The lever itself must be built of two levers which
are directly connected to each other and a beam of a length not exceeding 50
centimeters.

Simple Machines
---------------
Simple machines are devices that modify normally by amplifying, a force or
change its direction. When working with simple machines, it is important to
recognize that force is a vector quantity. For instance, you do not just have 1
N of force, you have 1 N of force downward. Be sure to take this into account
when doing your math.

Remember that simple machines are what make up compound machines. So, a wheel
could be thought of as a simple machine, but a cart could be thought of as a
compound machine, since it uses wheels in tandem with other machines.

Finally, you should know that simple machines are not motorized. A motor would
be an input force, not the machine itself. All the machine does is provide a
*mechanical advantage*, or factor of amplification, to the input force in order
to produce an output force, possible changing the direction of the force in the
process. Be aware that there are two types of mechanical advantage. First off
is ideal mechanical advantage. This is only applicable if you are in a
frictionless environment, not in the real world. Secondly, you have an actual
mechanical advantage, which does account for wear and tear as well as for
friction. The actual mechanical advantage can be calculated as the ratio of the
input force to the output force.

### Levers
Levers are simple machines generally designed to amplify an input force. A
lever is essentially a beam connected to a hinge. This hinge is called the
*fulcrum*. The ideal mechanical advantage of a lever is the ratio of the
distance from the fulcrum to the point where the force is applied to the lever
(L) to the distance from the fulcrum to the point where force is outputted (F),
or F/L. An example of a lever is shown below.

![Lever Forces](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Simple_lever_forces.svg/389px-Simple_lever_forces.svg.png "Lever Forces")

On a lever, the output force always comes from the opposite end of the input
force. Generally, the output force will be applied on one end, and the input
applied all the way on the other. If this is true, then F + T will always be
equal to the length of the lever.

### Wheel and Axles
A wheel and axle is a wheel attached to a rod, the axle, in such a way that the
wheel will rotate together with the axle. This machine is generally used to
lift weights. This is achieved by winding rope around the axle and attaching
the weight to the end of the rope. As the wheel rotates, it will lift the
weight up or down. In this form, the wheel and axle is called a *windlass*. An
example windlass is shown below.

![Windlass](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Wheelaxle_quackenbos.gif "Windlass")

To determine whether something is a wheel and axle, you should look for two
things. First off, you should test to make sure the machine contains two
cylinders. Next, you should make sure they both rotate on the same axis.
Provided both are true, you can be sure the device is a wheel and axle.
Remember that this device must be a physical system. So, the motion of one
cylinder must affect the motion of the other.

The ideal mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle is the radius of the wheel
divided by the radius of the axle. The wheel should be considered to be the
larger cylinder of the system and the axle the smaller one.

### Inclined Planes
Most commonly called ramps, inclined planes are slopes that a weight will be
slid up. More specifically, it can be defined as a surface where one end is
higher than the other. Such devices are normally used for moving a weight
vertically, similar to a windlass. An example of an inclined plane is shown
below.

![Inclined Plane](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Free_body_diagram.png "Inclined Plane")

The ideal mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is equal to the reciprocal
of the sine of the slope angle. If you consider the inclined plane to be a
right triangle, with the hypotenuse as its length and the legs as the ground
and its height off the ground, the slope angle is equal to the angle adjacent
to the ground and the hypotenuse.

### Wedges
At first sight, wedges seem to be inclined planes. They are in fact very
similar in purpose to an inclined plane. Both can be used to lift objects. A
wedge, however, is used for another application. Basically, the task of a wedge
is to separate two surfaces. Unlike with an inclined plane, this does not need
to be done vertically. Additionally, the force comes from the blunt edge of the
wedge, not a pulling force upon the object itself. An example of a wedge is
shown below.

![Wedge](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Klin.jpg "Wedge Forces")

Wedges are probably most familiar in two objects. The first is the hatchet,
which has a purpose of separating wood into multiple pieces. Secondly, there is
the door wedge. Here, force under the wedge keeps a door from closing, even
though it is applying force in that direction. In general, a wedge can be
considered a portable inclined plane.

Wedges work by taking a force and making it perpendicular to the direction in
which it is going. To understand this, it is important to recall that forces
are vector quantities. This perpendicular force is generally called by another
name within the realm of physics. This name is *normal force*.

To calculate the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge, you must simply divide
the length of its slope by its width. Therefore, if your wedge is a right
triangle with the hypotenuse facing upwards, the mechanical advantage would be
the length of its base divided by the length of the hypotenuse.

### Screws
A screw is similar to a motor in principle. Whereas a motor is used to convert
electrical energy to physical force, a screw is used to convert torque to
linear force. All screws utilize the fact that a rotating helix can cause
linear force.

To understand this, you can consider a screw to be an inclined plane wrapped
around a cylinder. This allows you to see the connection between torque and
linear force in application to a helix. An example screw is shown below.

![Screw](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Screw_demonstrator.png "Screw")

Finding the ideal mechanical advantage of a screw is too complex for this
application, since it requires a strong base in physics. However, you should
know that the mechanical advantage increases as the distance between the
threads increases. Conversely, the mechanical advantage of a screw decreases as
the distance between the threads decreases.

### Pulleys
A pulley is essentially a wheel and axle. However, it is designed to perform a
very different tax. Instead of changing linear motion into torque, a pulley
provides a mechanical advantage to linear motion.

If you look at a pulley, you will recognize a wheel and axle. The will
generally has a groove, in order to support a rope or string. This design makes
it possible for the wheel to not only provide a mechanical advantage to a
force, but to change its direction as well. This can prove very useful in
compound machines, since not only are you supplied with a method to convert
torque into linear motion and vice versa, but you are also supplied with a
method to change the direction of a force, even 180 degrees.

The most recognizable machine utilizing the pulley is a block and tackle, which
threads rope between two pulleys in order to gain a mechanical advantage. The
more times the rope is threaded between the pulleys, the greater the mechanical
advantage of the machine. In the block and tackle, the ideal mechanical
advantage is equal to the number of parts of rope that support the block. This
is best demonstrated by the diagram below, where the gun tackle has an ideal
mechanical advantage of two, and each subsequent machine has a mechanical
advantage one higher than the previous one.

Mechanical Advantage
--------------------
Mechanical advantage is the very essence of machines. Mechanical advantage
works on the principle that you cannot modify the amount of work in a system.
Therefore, it is necessary to modify a velocity in order to modify a force, and
vice versa. This factor of modification is the mechanical advantage of a
machine. For instance, a gun tackle has an ideal mechanical advantage of two.
Therefore, it will double a force and halve a velocity. This allows it to
increase a force without ever modifying the work in the machine.

There are two types of mechanical advantage. The one most often referred to is
the ideal mechanical advantage. This is the mechanical advantage of a machine
with no wear and tear or friction. An ideal mechanical advantage will always be
higher than the mechanical advantage observed in the real world. However, it is
also the easiest to calculate, since there are less variables to consider.

The second type of mechanical advantage is actual mechanical advantage. This is
what will be observed in the real world. To calculate the actual mechanical
advantage of a machine, you must divide the output force by the input force.

### Mechanical Advantage of Simple Machines
The ideal mechanical advantage of a simple machine is generally very easy to
calculate, since you only have one machine to account for in your system. If
you need to find the mechanical advantage of a simple machine, you can use one
of the methods provided in the [Simple Machines Section](#simple-machines) of
this guide.

### Mechanical Advantage of Compound Machines
The ideal mechanical advantage of a compound machine is slightly more difficult
than that of a simple machine. For any compound machine, the ideal mechanical
advantage is equal to the product of the ideal mechanical advantages of the
[simple machines](#simple-machines) it is composed of. Likewise, the actual
mechanical advantage of a compound machine is equal to products of the actual
mechanical advantages of the simple machines it is composed of, or simply the
ratio of its output force to its input force.

Joints
------
Joints are used to connect simple machines, forming
[compound machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_machine#Compound_machine).
They constrain the movement of simple machines connected to other simple
machines. This concept can be used in the production of very complex machines,
such as in mechanical hands. Such systems of simple machines connected by
joints are called
[kinematic chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematic_chain).

### Revolute Joints
Revolute joints are used to restrain a pair of simple machines, or
[kinematic pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematic_pair), to one degree,
or dimension, of motion. These are often seen in doors, which are designed to
rotate around the joints in a plane.

A revolute joint looks similar to a cylinder surrounded by rigid solids
wrapped around it. This prevents the movement of an object attached to it in
any direction other than along a plane. An example revolute joint is shown
below.

![Revolute Joint](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/L-Kloben2.png "Revolute Joint")

### Sliding Joints
Like a revolute joint, a sliding joint is designed to restrain movement to one
degree. However, this degree is not rotational. Instead, it restrains movement
to a line.

Sliding joints also look very similar to revolute joints. They are essentially
cylinders wrapped around by a single rigid solid, as opposed to the multiple
solids in a revolute joint. An example of a sliding joint is shown below.

![Sliding Joint](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Slider_joint.png "Sliding Joint")

### Cam Joints
A cam joint restricts rotational motion to one degree of linear motion. This is
done by variating the length of a point from an axle. To accomplish this, a cam
joint becomes essentially a circular object with a portion of it extended to a
point. An example of a cam joint is shown below.

![Cam Joint](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Cams.svg "Cam Joint")

### Gear Joints
Gear joints are designed to work in pairs to change the direction of rotational
motion. A gear joint looks like a cogwheel, or a circle with teeth extended
from it. This joint is then attached to an axis through a whole in its center.
An example gear joint is shown below.

Putting it All Together
-----------------------
To understand compound machines, you need to see them as a set of modifications
to a force. These modifications are done through simple machines, which provide
advantage, and compound machines, which restrict motion. So long as you are
able to separate compound machines into combinations of simple machines and
joints, you can easily understand how they work.

A good example of a compound machine is the wheelbarrow. On a wheelbarrow, you
can find two mechanisms. The first is the lever. The wheelbarrow is mounted on
a fulcrum. This fulcrum is placed to make it easy to lift the wheelbarrow and
its contents. Additionally, the wheelbarrow contains a wheel. This allows it to
reduce friction to the ground, so it is easy to move. Since there is only one
wheel, the wheelbarrow can be pivoted in any direction.

Building a Compound Lever
-------------------------
Compound levers are complex machines designed to exploit the concept that
resistance from one lever in the system of levers will act as power for the
next. A good example of a compound lever is in nail clippers, which utilize
force downwards on one lever to act as force upwards on the next.

The most common compound lever used for measuring masses is the Roberval
Balance. This balance uses two levers to hold vertical rods, which hold
horizontal pans. Because of the structure of the Roberval Balance, the pans are
always horizontal. This means that the position of the masses on the pans does
not modify the outcome. Such a principle can prove very useful when measuring
rounded masses, which have a tendency to roll.

The construction of a Roberval balance is fairly simple. As a result, it can be
easily explained through the below diagram.

As you can see, the device is relatively simple. You should also utilize the
Law of the Lever in your device with known masses. That way, you could slide
your own masses across the lever to your own markings for masses.

History of Compound Machines
----------------------------
Naturally, the idea of the compound machine originated with the idea of the
simple machine, which made up the compound machine. To that extent, [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes)
can be given credit. He first postulated the simple machine in the 3rd century
BCE. At this time, he claimed there were three simple machines, the lever, the
pulley, and the screw. Later Greek scientists also declared the windlass and
the wedge to be simple machines.

While the Greeks did have a good understanding of the statics of simple
machines, how they balanced forces, they lacked an understanding of the
dynamics. This understanding came from Renaissance scientists. Renaissance
scientists theorized the ideas of work and the trade-off between force and
distance. The first great discovery by Renaissance scientists related to simple
machines was by [Simon Stevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Stevin), who
derived the formula for the mechanical advantage of inclined planes. Later on,
[Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_vinci) theorized
the rules of sliding friction in the late 15th or early 16th century CE.
However, he never published this work.

However, the most influential Renaissance scientist was
[Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_galilei), who developed
the complete theory of the dynamics of simple machines, which was published
during the year 1600 CE. Perhaps the most important discovery of Galileo was
the realization that simple machines do not create energy; they only transform
it.

As for compound machines, the door into the understanding of them was opened by
[Franz Reuleaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Reuleaux). He fathered the
theory of kinematics during the 19th century CE. Kinematics involved the
understanding of simple machines connected by joints. Without such a theory,
today's machines would not at all be possible.
