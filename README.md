Simple and Compound Machines
===========================
This project is meant to serve as an introduction for compound machines, as well
as the simple machines they are composed of. The guide will be focusing
specifically on educating people enough to be prepared for the compound machines
challenge in the *Science Olympiad*. However, people who want to learn the
basics of compound machines can benefit from reading this as well, as it will
give them a general knowledge of the subject.

Readers can expect to be able to read this document from the top down. Topics
will be organized by the level of knowledge required to read learn them. For
instance, you can expect to learn about a lever before you learn of machines
utilizing levers.

Additionally, readers will learn the expectations of the compound machines
portion of the *Science Olympiad*, as well as how the competition will work. All
in all, you can expect to be totally prepared for the competition after reading
this document, provided you study the material.

*Science Olympiad* Competition
----------------------------
During the *Science Olympiad*, competitors will be tested on their knowledge of
compound machines by being asked questions on them. Additionally, they are
expected to use a compound lever to determine the quantity of an unknown mass.
The former will require studying, whereas the latter requires competitors to
have a good understanding of *mechanical advantage*. Additionally, students
will have to build a compound lever themselves, as their prebuild.

Officially, the event is split into two parts. The first part is the written
test. The test will include questions on basic concepts of compound machines,
as well as calculations and the history of compound machines. For the second
event, competitors are given a known mass and an unknown mass. Using a compound
lever, they are expected to determine the unknown mass. The second portion of
the competition will be graded on accuracy and speed.

Competitors are expected to bring their compound lever, a binder of notes, a
calculator, and other tools or supplies. Materials held in the binder should be
firmly within it. Judges can be expected to turn the binders upside down, to
test if anything falls out. The lever itself must be built of two levers which
are directly connected to each other and a beam of a length not exceeding 50
centimeters.
